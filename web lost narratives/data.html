         <p><strong>EPIC HAND WASHING IN A TIME OF LOST NARRATIVES</strong> is an iteration on the project A Kitchen of One's Own, developed for the media wall in the Photographer's Gallery (London). This iteration of the project displays a set of 74 videos from the EPIC KITCHENS dataset that were trained for machine learning with the verb "wash" and the paired noun "hand". This speculative remix juxtaposes a dataset of texts created by the authorsâ€”selections of quotes from literature written in or about the plague.  
         
         <br /><br />This project was created by xtine burrough and Sabrina Starnaman with technical direction provided by Dale MacDonald. It was developed for the web to showcase on The Photographer's Gallery site.</p>
